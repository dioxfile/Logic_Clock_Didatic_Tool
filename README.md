# Logic_Clock_Didatic_Tool

![alt text](https://github.com/dioxfile/Vector_Clock/blob/master/Imagens/QRCode_Vector_clock.png)

Code in Python to synchronize the computer clock using the [Lamport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport) Logic Clock method.

People use physical time to order events. For example, we say that an event at 8:15 AM occurs before an event at 8:16 AM. In distributed systems, physical clocks are not always precise, so we can't rely on physical time to order events. Instead, we can use logical clocks to create a partial or total ordering of events. This APPLICATION explores the concept and implementation of the logical clocks invented by Leslie Lamport in his seminal paper Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System.

# What are the Possible Applications?
Its purpose is the synchronization of physical (e.g., CMOS clock) and logical clocks of computers connected to the same network.

## Methodology.
* OS: Debian-Based Linux Systems and Windows 11 Enterprise.
* CPU: Intel Core i7 Q 740 @ 8x 1.734GHz
* GPU: GeForce GT 425M
* RAM: 7956MiB <br/> 

* __Test hardware:__ Intel (R) Pentium 4 (TM) 3.0 GHz, 1 GB RAM, HD 40 GB, 10/100 Fast Ethernet network
* __Test realize:__ The tests were performed in a _testbed_ with 8 computers in the _Laboratory of Computer Networks (UNEMAT)_, and all the computers of the laboratory were configured in a network class A 113.167.9.0/24. In order to synchronize, the software takes into account the time correct at the highest hour. In this way, the clocks of the test machines were manually and randomly delayed.

# Prerequisites
* Pyhton3 (Or more)
* Python3-wxgtk4.0
* python3-pip
* ipaddr
* Python3-netifaces
* Python3-dateutil
* Python3-pubsub


# What do you need to use this software?
* You will need a GNU/Linux Ubuntu 20.04 Focal; Linux Mint 20.1 Ulyssa or other Linux system.
* And/Or Windows 11 Enterprise.
* Internet connection for download.

Probably the software will also work on any other SO, but it has only been tested on the systems listed above.

## For x86_64 Debian-based distributions and Windows 11 Enterprise<br/> 
These are the necessary packages and modules.
The version may not necessarily be the same, but these versions have been tested and confirmed the operation.

* 1. PYTHON3 <br/>
Package: python3 <br/>
Version: 3.8.2-0ubuntu2 <br/>

* 2. WXGTK4<br/>
Package: python3-wxgtk4.0<br/>
Version: 4.0.7+dfsg-2build1 <br/>

* 3. PIP-3<br/>
Package: python3-pip<br/>
Version: 22.0.2<br/>

* 4. IPADDR<br/>
Package: ipaddr<br/>
Version: 2.2.0<br/>

* 5. NETIFACES<br/>
Package: python3-netifaces<br/>
Version: 0.10.4-1ubuntu4<br/>

* 6. DATEUTIL<br/>
Package: python3-dateutil<br/>
Version: 2.7.3-3ubuntu1<br/>

* 7. PUBSUB<br/>
Package: python3-pubsub<br/>
Version: 4.0.3-4<br/>


***********************************************************************************************
## How to install it in Debian-based Systems?

* For x86_64<br/>
* Download from git INSTALL.sh<br/>
* Permit to file INSTALL.sh<br/>
  `$sudo chmod +x INSTALL.sh`

* Obs: For the above command to work the terminal must be open where the file is located.<br/>

* Run the file<br/>
  `$sudo ./INSTALL.sh`

***********************************************************************************************
## You can do an installation automatically by running the file 'INSTALL.sh'. But if you want to install manually just follow the steps below.

* In Debian-Based Systems.

* First, you will download the package and later install it. Once the installation is finished you can delete the downloaded `*.deb` files.


1. INSTALL PYTHON3<br/>
`$sudo apt install python3`<br/>

2. INSTALE WXGTK4<br/>
`$sudo apt install python3-wxgtk4.0`<br/>

3. INSTALL IPADDR (PIP)<br/>
`$sudo apt install python3-pip`
`$sudo pip3 install ipaddr`<br/>


5. DOWNLOAD NETIFACES<br/>
`$sudo apt install python3-netifaces`

6. INSTALL IPADDR<br/>
`$sudo apt install python-ipaddr`<br/>

7. INSTALL DATEUTIL<br/>
`sudo apt install python3-dateutil`<br/>

8. DOWNLOAD PUBSUB<br/>
`sudo apt install python3-pubsub`<br/>

***********************************************************************************************

## How to install it in Windows 11 Enterprise?

* For x86_64<br/>
  Download from git INSTALL-WIN.ps1 <br/>
* On Windows 11, install "vs_BuildTools" from the following link: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/ <br/>
* After that, you need to run it as an administrator and check the following tools as shown in Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4 (e.g., where the boxes are checked) <br/>
* Now click Install and wait for the installation (e.g., this may take a few minutes depending on your Internet connection) <br/>
* Now go to the Windows search bar and type PowerShell and in the PowerShell application, right-click and run as administrator <br/>
* At the PowerShell prompt, run the following command: `ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` <br/>
* If prompted, press A to confirm the action. This will set the RemoteSigned execution policy for all users <br/>
* If you want to set the execution policy for the Current User only, use the Scope parameter followed by the username. For example: `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSgined -Scope CurrentUser` <br/>
* After that, download the INSTALL.ps1 script and run it at the PowerShell command prompt, for example: `.\INSTALL.ps1` <br/>
* After installing python3 and all necessary libraries (e.g., Pyhton3, wxgtk, pip, ipaddr, netifaces, dateutil, and pubsub) download the following files from git: `ds_logic_clocks_mc_30.py and varglobal.py` <br/>
* Now go to the folder where the files were downloaded and run `ds_logic_clocks_mc_30.py` as administrator (e.g., clicking it twice) <br/>
* After that, the following screen will appear (Figure 5): <br/>

# How to use it?

*  IMPORTANT: To change the computer's time you must run the application as administrator/root user.<br/>

You just need to run the file with python <br/>
Linux (e.g., Bash/dash prompt) <br/>
`$ sudo python3 ds_logic_clocks_mc_30.py` <br/>
Windows (e.g., PowerShell prompt)<br/>
`c:\Users\Administrator> python.exe ds_logic_clocks_mc_30.py` <br/>
**************************************************************

The simplest way to use eh the "Broadcast IPv4"<br/>

* 1 - Shows the time that is "wrong"<br/>

* 2 - Click "Bind IP/Port" to make a connection<br/>

* 3 - You can choose between automatic and manual<br/>
Automatic: Send a message every 3 seconds<br/>
Manual: Send a message each time you click on it<br/>

* 4 - Note that the time has changed, important to realize that it has changed to an hour higher than it was already. Your time is now synchronized.<br/>

# Possibles errors

* If any module for unknown reasons has not been installed

Any module error that you may have to re-view the "HOW TO USE" session and manually install each module in sequence according to the tutorial. Follow steps 1 through 10.2.<br/>

In the Debian system, you may have a user error<br/>
If you get the error "./INSTALL.sh: sudo: not found". By default sudo is not installed, but you can install it. <br/>

First enable su-mode:<br/>
`$su`<br/>
 
Install sudo<br/>
`#apt install sudo -y`<br/>

After that you would need to play around with users and permissions. Give sudo right to your own user.<br/>
`#usermod -aG sudo yoursername`<br/>

Edit the file 'sudoers'<br/>
`#nano /etc/sudoers`<br/>

#User privilege specification<br/>
```shellcript
root ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL<br/>
"yoursername" ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL <br/><br/>
```
#The top line was the one we added. <br/>
#Replace 'yoursername' with the name of your user who wants to have root permission<br/>
`#exit`

* update error

Obs: In some cases Debian, when new, in the updates configuration file "/etc/apt/sources.list", the line referring to the cdrom is not commented out, this causes an error at the time of the update and consequently when installing some programs and libraries with apt.
It is advisable to comment on any lines referring to the use of "cdrom" sources, and it is strongly recommended to use official Debian sources, both "Debian" and "security".
