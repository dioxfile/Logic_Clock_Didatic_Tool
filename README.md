# Vector_Clock
Code in Python to Synchronize the computer clock using the Lamport method.

People use physical time to order events. For example, we say that an event at 8:15 AM occurs before an event at 8:16 AM. In distributed systems, physical clocks are not always precise, so we can't rely on physical time to order events. Instead, we can use logical clocks to create a partial or total ordering of events. This article explores the concept of and an implementation of the logical clocks invented by Leslie Lamport in his seminal paper Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System.

# What are the Possible Applications?
Its purpose is the synchronization of logical clocks of computers connected to the same network.

# Prerequisites
* Pyhton2.7
* Idle-Python2.7
* Python-Dateutil
* Python-Netifaces
* Python-Ipaddr
* Python-WXgtk2.8

# What do you need to use the software?
* You will need a GNU/Linux Ubuntu 18.04.1 cosmic /  KERNEL x86_64 Linux 4.18.0-10-generic or Debian 9.5 Stretch / KERNEL x86_64 Linux 4.9.0-8-amd64. 
* Internet connection for download.
* OBS: Software does not work on 32 bits systems

Probably the software will also work on any other Debian-based distribution, but it has only been tested on the systems listed above.


# How to install

* You can do an installation automatically by running the file 'INSTALL.sh'.

# Why the development?
It was developed by Professor Diogenes on the campus of UNEMAT BBG - MT in order to ... and being under my responsibility the documentation and implementation of the project in GitHub

# Is this the only system of sync?
I do not know

# Is this system 100% complete?
Yes, it can be used in full according to the proposal.
